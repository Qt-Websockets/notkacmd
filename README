Notka Online Clipboard
=====================

Notka is small online storage for text.
In Polish it means 'short text', 'text snippet', 'scribble', 'chit'.
You can open your notka in browser from any internet connected device
and use/edit/save your text.

In technology terms it is:

        - small http server serving http/javascript content
          written with React (https://facebook.github.io/react)

        - C++ backend server written with Qt

        - MySql database


Try it
======

Deploy your notka with npm (npm install, npm start).
Open notka in beowser and create your texts, optionally protecting them
with password. Click 'save' to store text in the cloud, then access it
from  http://notka.online or by direct URL link and have your notka back.

Dirct URL link access (API usage):

http://yourserver/title - to get notka which is not protected with password
http://yourserver/title/password - to get notka which is protected with password

So if you created notka "foo" with no password, you can share it using link: http://yourserver/foo
If it is protected additionally by password "bar" share it with: http://yourserver/foo/bar
